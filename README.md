# Prediction of House Prices using Linear Regression

My teammates, Syed Huzaifa Jawad and Adil Pervez, and I made this project as part of our course, "Data Science", in the seventh semester.

We first took our dataset from Kaggle. Then we cleaned the data and identified the top 5 features with the strongest correlation with sale price. We then used 10 different regression models which used these 5 features to predict the sale price.

The effectiveness of the models was measured by RMSE scores and adjusted R squared scores. We then used ensemble learning to combine all ten models. The project also includes lots of visualisations to aid easy understanding.
